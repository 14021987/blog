This post is just a pointer to [another post on the R Views blog](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2020/03/19/simulating-covid-19-interventions-with-r/) that I wrote on the use of simulations to explore the efects of various interventions on COVID-19 spread. It contains a few more simulation experiments on lock-downs, with some interesting results, explained in the [post](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2020/03/19/simulating-covid-19-interventions-with-r/).
